    <h1> LETITBE.txt: an AI-powered lyricist </h1>

    <h2> LETITBE.txt is an AI-powered lyric generator, which utilizes machine
        learning insights from the Modzy Graph Embeddings to predict and 
        generate realistic lyrics from The Beatles' full discography.

    <h2> How it works: </h2>
    <h3> 
        LETITBE.txt's python scripts search genius.com, a lyric annotation
        website, using the Genius API to retrieve URLs for every Beatles song.
        (anthologies and collaborations excluded). Then, each song webpage's
        HTML is scraped using BeautifulSoup4 to extract the plaintext lyrics.
        <br>
        After formatting out excess markup text, all song lyrics are then fed
        through a word-processor algorithm to generate a "Markov Chain": a
        sequential representation of existing word-to-word pairings as found
        in the input lyric data.

        Markov Chains are powerful models for generating natural grammatical
        sentences. Without an underlying ruleset for grammar and semantics,
        they can create natural, understandable sentences that aren't
        contained in the original dataset!

        However, Markov Chains are limited by their training data. They 
        ultimately can't generate all possible grammatical sentences using
        their input data words - see how no path exists for the sentence
        below:

        Furthermore, they struggle to model long-distance dependencies and
        avoid possible 'cycles' within the graph:
